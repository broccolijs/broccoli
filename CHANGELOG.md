# 1.1.3

* Update dependencies

# 1.1.2

* Update findup-sync dependency

# 1.1.1

* Fix option parsing for `--port`

# 1.1.0

  creation.

# 1.0.0

* Release without change

# 1.0.0-beta.8

* Builder throws an error when a watched input directory is missing
* Rework watcher
* Pull broccoli-sane-watcher functionality into core
* Update findup-sync dependency

# 1.0.0-beta.7

# 1.0.0-beta.6

* Add `build` event to watcher

# 1.0.0-beta.5

* Remove redundant `beginBuild`/`endBuild` (formerly `start`/`end`) events on builder

# 1.0.0-beta.4

* Improve test suite

# 1.0.0-beta.3

* Minor cosmetic changes

# 1.0.0-beta.2

* Add `watcher.watch()` method. `Watcher` no longer automatically starts
  watching; instead, you must call this method explicitly. It returns a promise
  that is fulfilled if you later call `watcher.quit()`, or rejected if watching
  one of the source directories fails.

    - `server` will call `watcher.watch()` for you.
    - In contrast, `getMiddleware` expects a watcher that is already watching.

# 1.0.0-beta.1

* Drop support for plugins that implement only the old `.read/.rebuild` API
* Fail build when a source node is a file rather than a directory
* Fail build when a source node doesn't exist
* Builder API changes:

    - `new Builder` has a `tmpdir` option, which defaults to `os.tmpdir()`
      (typically `/tmp`); pass `{ tmpdir: './tmp' }` to get the old behavior
    - `.build()` no longer returns a promise to the output path; instead, the
      output path stored at `builder.outputPath` and doesn't change between
      builds
    - `start`, `end`, `nodeStart`, `nodeEnd` events renamed to
      `beginBuild`, `endBuild`, `beginNode`, `endNode`
    - Nodes passed to `nodeBegin`/`nodeEnd` arguments are "node wrapper"
      objects (also accessible at `builder.nodeWrappers`); timings now
      reside at `nodeWrapper.buildState.selfTime/totalTime` and are in
      milliseconds, not nanoseconds
    - `build()` no longer takes a `willReadStringTree` callback argument;
      instead, source directories are recorded at `builder.watchedPaths`

* Watcher API changes:

    - Add `watcher.quit()` method, which returns a promise until a running
      build has finished (if any)
    - Rename `watcher.current` to `watcher.currentBuild`, and remove
      `watcher.then`
    - Use `RSVP.EventTarget` instead of `EventEmitter` for events

* Build error objects have been changed to `Builder.BuildError` objects, which
  contain additional information at `err.broccoliPayload`
